# A Lambda calculus interpreter on Python

I want to write my own Compiler/Interpreter/JIT (all three of them) this is a start step to learn about eager and lazy evaluation , scope of variables, type theory and others.


To details about implementation (not doc) see my [blog](None).


This interpreter is a instable work in progress.
